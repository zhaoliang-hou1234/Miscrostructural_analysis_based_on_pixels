# Miscrostructural_analysis_based_on_pixels
The code help the microstructural analysis for mineral and crystals, in structural elements, such as preferred orientation, density, size distribution and mean size, and aspect ratio for grains. The output are histmap for grain size distributin and aspect ratio, rose diagram for preferred orientation.
